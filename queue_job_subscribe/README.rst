Queue Job Suscription
=====================

This module allows users to
be member of group Job Queue Manager without becoming follower of failed jobs.
This can avoid for some users to receive a lot of emails in case of failing
jobs.

Usage
=====

On the user configuration form, there is new Job Notifications checkbox.

If checked, the user becomes follower of failed jobs if he/she is part of the
Job Queue Manager group.

If not checked, the user does not become follower of failed jobs.
