        """Return a ``DelayableRecordset``

        The returned instance allows to enqueue any method of the recordset's
        Model.

        Usage::

            self.env['res.users'].with_delay().write({'name': 'test'})

        ``with_delay()`` accepts job properties which specify how the job will
        be executed.

        Usage with job properties::

            delayable = env['a.model'].with_delay(priority=30, eta=60*60*5)
            delayable.export_one_thing(the_thing_to_export)
            # => the job will be executed with a low priority and not before a
            # delay of 5 hours from now

        :param priority: Priority of the job, 0 being the higher priority.
                         Default is 10.
        :param eta: Estimated Time of Arrival of the job. It will not be
                    executed before this date/time.
        :param max_retries: maximum number of retries before giving up and set
                            the job state to 'failed'. A value of 0 means
                            infinite retries.  Default is 5.
        :param description: human description of the job. If None, description
                            is computed from the function doc or name
        :param channel: the complete name of the channel to use to process
                        the function. If specified it overrides the one
                        defined on the function
        :param identity_key: key uniquely identifying the job, if specified
                             and a job with the same key has not yet been run,
                             the new job will not be added. It is either a
                             string, either a function that takes the job as
                             argument (see :py:func:`..job.identity_exact`).
        :return: instance of a DelayableRecordset

        Note for developers: if you want to run tests or simply disable
        jobs queueing for debugging purposes, you can:

            a. set the env var `TEST_QUEUE_JOB_NO_DELAY=1`
            b. pass a ctx key `test_queue_job_no_delay=1`

        In tests you'll have to mute the logger like:

            @mute_logger('odoo.addons.queue_job.models.base')
        """
        if os.getenv("TEST_QUEUE_JOB_NO_DELAY"):

            return self
