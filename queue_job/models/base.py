        The returned instance allow to enqueue any method of the recordset's

        Usage::

            self.env['res.users'].with_delay().write({'name': 'test'})

        In the line above, in so far ``write`` is allowed to be delayed with
        ``@job``, the write will be executed in an asynchronous job.

        :param priority: Priority of the job, 0 being the higher priority.
                         Default is 10.
        :param eta: Estimated Time of Arrival of the job. It will not be
                    executed before this date/time.
        :param max_retries: maximum number of retries before giving up and set
                            the job state to 'failed'. A value of 0 means
                            infinite retries.  Default is 5.
        :param description: human description of the job. If None, description
                            is computed from the function doc or name
        :param channel: the complete name of the channel to use to process
                        the function. If specified it overrides the one
                        defined on the function
        :param identity_key: key uniquely identifying the job, if specified
                             and a job with the same key has not yet been run,
                             the new job will not be added.

        Note for developers: if you want to run tests or simply disable
        jobs queueing for debugging purposes, you can:

            a. set the env var `TEST_QUEUE_JOB_NO_DELAY=1`
            b. pass a ctx key `test_queue_job_no_delay=1`

        In tests you'll have to mute the logger like:
