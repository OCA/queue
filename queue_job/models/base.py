        :param max_retries: maximum number of retries before giving up and set
                            the job state to 'failed'. A value of 0 means
                            infinite retries.  Default is 5.

        """Patch a method to be automatically delayed as job method when called

        This patch method has to be called in ``_register_hook`` (example
        below).

        When a method is patched, any call to the method will not directly
        execute the method's body, but will instead enqueue a job.

        When a ``context_key`` is set when calling ``_patch_job_auto_delay``,
        the patched method is automatically delayed only when this key is
        ``True`` in the caller's context. It is advised to patch the method
        with a ``context_key``, because making the automatic delay *in any
        case* can produce nasty and unexpected side effects (e.g. another
        module calls the method and expects it to be computed before doing
        something else, expecting a result, ...).

        A typical use case is when a method in a module we don't control is
        called synchronously in the middle of another method, and we'd like all
        the calls to this method become asynchronous.

        The options of the job usually passed to ``with_delay()`` (priority,
        description, identity_key, ...) can be returned in a dictionary by a
        method named after the name of the method suffixed by ``_job_options``
        which takes the same parameters as the initial method.

        It is still possible to force synchronous execution of the method by
        setting a key ``_job_force_sync`` to True in the environment context.

        Example patching the "foo" method to be automatically delayed as job
        (the job options method is optional):

        .. code-block:: python

            # original method:
            def foo(self, arg1):
                print("hello", arg1)

            def large_method(self):
                # doing a lot of things
                self.foo("world)
                # doing a lot of other things

            def button_x(self):
                self.with_context(auto_delay_foo=True).large_method()

            # auto delay patch:
            def foo_job_options(self, arg1):
                return {
                  "priority": 100,
                  "description": "Saying hello to {}".format(arg1)
                }

            def _register_hook(self):
                self._patch_method(
                    "foo",
                    self._patch_job_auto_delay("foo", context_key="auto_delay_foo")
                )
                return super()._register_hook()

        The result when ``button_x`` is called, is that a new job for ``foo``
        is delayed.
