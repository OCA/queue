About
#####

This is a framework to build connectors between OpenERP and external
systems or services.

OpenERP Connector has been developed by Camptocamp_.

It is maintained by Camptocamp_, Akretion_ and several contributors.

The `source is on launchpad`_.

This connector is designed to have a modular and generic core, with the
ability to extend it with extension modules for new features or customizations.

The framework is:

 * **Open Source** (license `AGPL version 3`_)
 * An **add-on for OpenERP**, not an standalone application.
 * Not only designed to connect OpenERP with e-commerce backends,
   rather it is **adaptable** for any type of service.
 * Not realtime. Synchronizations are launched **asynchronously** using
   a **job queue**.
 * An assortment of building blocks, it does not force to a certain
   implementation but leaves the final choice to the
   developer how to use the proposed pieces.
