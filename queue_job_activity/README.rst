Usage
=====

There is no particular usage, but mail_activity_* modules in the OCA/social repo
are desired to make the activities created here easily accessible.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Use the mail_activity_team module to assign activities to the team instead a user
  within a group

* It would be nice to create activities on the records that made the jobs to failed
