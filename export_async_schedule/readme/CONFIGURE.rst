The configuration of a scheduled export is based on export lists.

To create an export list:

* open the list view of the model to export
* select at least one record, and open "Action → Export"
* select the fields to export and save using "Save fields list".

To configure a scheduled export:

* open "Settings → Technical → Automation → Scheduled Exports"
* create a scheduled export by filling the form

A Scheduled Action named "Send Scheduled Exports" checks every hour
if Scheduled Exports have to be executed.
