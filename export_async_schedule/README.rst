Add a new Automation feature: Scheduled Exports.
Based on an export list and a domain, an email is sent every X
hours/days/weeks/months to a selection of users.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

The configuration of a scheduled export is based on export lists.

To create an export list:

* open the list view of the model to export
* select at least one record, and open "Action → Export"
* select the fields to export and save using "Save fields list".

To configure a scheduled export:

* open "Settings → Technical → Automation → Scheduled Exports"
* create a scheduled export by filling the form

A Scheduled Action named "Send Scheduled Exports" checks every hour
if Scheduled Exports have to be executed.

Usage
=====

When the configuration of a Scheduled Export is done, their execution
is automatic.

Users will receive an email containing a link to download the exported file at
the specified frequency. The attachments stay in the database for 7 days by
default (it can be changed with the system parameter ``attachment.ttl``.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* We could configure a custom TTL (time-to-live) for each scheduled export
